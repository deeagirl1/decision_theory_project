    "Within this project, we are going to implement the dots & boxes game by using different techniques learned during this course. The idea is to create the dots & boxes environment and play with a smart agent and a random agent. The agents will simulate the game. Our goal is to make the smart agent more efficient than the smart agent."

    "## 1. Definition of game\n",
    "Dots and boxes is a game originally played with pen and paper. The aim of the game is to get more boxes in your possession then your opponent. You start the game with an empty grid. This grid consists of a square (x,y where x and y have the same length) with horizontal dots evenly divided and vertical dots beneath those horizontal dots. So, each dot it in a right angle with every other dot. When You connect four dots you can form a square or in this game called a block. You and your opponent take turns to join up two adjacent dots with a line. If any player forms a box they get a point and they also get to make another move. The player with the most boxes will win. This is not a game of chance; strategies can help a player to win."

The environment can be in one of these states $S = (S_0, S_1, ..., S_n)$, where n has a a value of 13, which is the end state, because you can maximum only set 2*6 lines in-between dots this is not including the beginning state without any lines.

This function works the same as play_game only when it is the opponents turn it will automatically play a random action. To initialise the game to let the random player go first, you have to indicate in the initialisation that random play is true (this is set to false as default). Like the play_game in play_random and in the initialisation you can also indicate if you want to play the results or not (default is true)."
