    "The code below defines all characteristics of the Markov Decision Process of the AIMA book in chapter 16 with the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- States: The agent is in one of the following positions {(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (1, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3)}.\n",
    "- Actions: The agent can choose between {Up, Down, Left, Right}\n",
    "- Transitions: There is a probability of 0.8/0.1/0.1 that action Up results in an upward/left/right movement, provided that the state exists. Movements 'outside the world' or to (2, 2) result in the state remaining the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "An SimpleMDPEnvironment object has the following methods:\n",
    "- reset() which brings the environment the start state, which is also returned\n",
    "- step(action) processes the action of the agent and returns the new state, done, reward (and optional debug info)\n",
    "- render() simple visualisation of the current state of the world\n",
    "\n",
    "To allow an agent to calculate optimal decisions using model information, these methods are also available:\n",
    "\n",
    "- get_possible_states() for iterating over all possible states\n",
    "- is_done(state) for excluding the stop states from the policy\n",
    "- get_reward(state) simplified version $R(s)$ of the general reward function: $R(s, a, s')$\n",
